## How to install

* Import ```outfits.sql``` to your database
* Include [this code](#code) somewhere you init first player connection
* Copy and paste ```skincreator``` folder to ```resources```
* Add ```start skincreator``` to your ```server.cfg``` file

## Code

This function will add user to the outfits SQL's table. This code must be included somewhere you init player (something like isFirstConnection function). It's server-side function.
```
MySQL.Async.execute("INSERT INTO outfits (idSteam) VALUES ('[SteamID of user or anything ID you use to identify unique player]')")
```

## Files

* ```ui/script.js``` JS for NUI elements
* ```ui/front.js``` JS for HTML interaction
* ```ui/styles.scss``` use this to edit CSS if you are comfortable with CSS pre-processor (must be compiled)
* ```ui/index.html``` use this to change the locale of the resource. Adjust locales/en.js to the locale you wish to use.
